# Market Basket Analysis Project (Python)

## Overview

This project applies **market basket analysis** using Python to identify relationships between products based on transaction data. The objective is to uncover frequently co-purchased items and generate actionable insights that can support cross-selling, bundling, and promotion strategies.

The project demonstrates analytical thinking and the practical use of association rule mining techniques.

## Dataset

* **Type**: Transactional purchase data
* **Structure**: Each record represents items purchased together in a single transaction
* **Purpose**: Used to analyze item associations and purchasing patterns

## Tools

* **Python**
* **Libraries**:

  * pandas
  * mlxtend (Apriori, association rules)
  * numpy

## Steps

1. Loaded and inspected transactional data
2. Transformed data into a suitable format for market basket analysis
3. Generated frequent itemsets using the Apriori algorithm
4. Created association rules based on support, confidence, and lift
5. Filtered and analyzed the strongest and most meaningful rules

## Results

* Identified frequently purchased item combinations
* Discovered strong association rules between products
* Provided insights that can inform marketing, product placement, and sales strategies
* Demonstrated the ability to apply data mining techniques to real-world business problems

## Deliverables

* Python notebook containing the full analysis
* Association rules and key insights derived from transaction data
* Short report
